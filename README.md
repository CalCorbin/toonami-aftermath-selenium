# Toonami Aftermath Test Suite

This is a small suite of Selenium tests written in Python for the fan website Toonami Aftermath(http://www.toonamiaftermath.com/). I am a huge fan of
classic Toonami and I thought this would be a fun exercise to show my support for their work.

## Instructions

Once you have navigated to the correct directory in terminal, the tests can be run in the terminal via:
`$ python toonamiTestSuite.py`
